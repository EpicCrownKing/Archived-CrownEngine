# CrownEngine
my engine

not really much to say? i'm working on an engine and going to be making projects that ramp up in complexity as i learn how to make a game engine
starting with breakout, then will most likely do a basic platformer and then perhaps a topdown game
again i really dunno what im doing so ig we'll wait and see if i do anything with it
